#Deliverables:

- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary. - I already had downloaded and installed everything form IDE's to python, to MySQL etc
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore). -
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.
  I had some issues while installing Dart, but I was able to resolve it by adding it to the environmental variables.
